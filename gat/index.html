      <p>Here at Dionysus we believe that knowledge is power. Knowledge is something that should be easily accessible and something that people find enjoyment in attaining. We believe that games bridge the gap between learning and fun and are a highly integral part of how we learn. Making games that focus on promoting learning and the betterment of all peoples regardless of background, race, and gender are what we believe help promote and healthy and enjoyable learning environment for all.</p>
      <p>We focus on inclusion and representation in games. Gamers are a group of people with diverse ethnic backgrounds and gender identities, and we try to be cognizant and respectful of the issues of marginalized groups as well as the universal appeal games have. We are also passionate about education and problem-solving through games, be it for children or adults. Everyone should have the equal opportunity to experiment and sate their curiosity through the unique medium games can offer.</p>
