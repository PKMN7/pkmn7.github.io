            <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The problem we’re aiming to solve is the issue of being unable to easily find or organize study groups with fellow students in your specific classes.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create more opportunities along with a straightforward communication method for students to continually connect with other classmates outside of the lecture hall in a way that is quick, safe, and most of all convenient. This way students can spend less time searching, and more time studying!</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Being unable to find peers to study with is a common problem across college campuses inside and outside of the classroom. This affects students who do not know many people, students who are too shy to randomly walk up to classmates to form groups, and even students who may not have these two issues but need to find someone to study with at times where running into people on campus is unlikely. For instance, there may be a student whose in a class where they don’t know any of their classmates and is unsure how to go about approaching people to study with. Or, another student who wants to study for an exam, but their usual partners aren’t available. And even if students do manage to get together a great study group, once the semester is over and a new one begins, they’d have to start the whole process over.</p>

<p>With our application, all this is made much easier - students can easily search for a study group without having to leave their current location, or let others on campus know that they’re hosting one. They’ll also be able to message others in the area or their group seamlessly within the application.</p>

<p>The benefits of study groups are numerous: students gain different perspectives on the material , have opportunities to learn anything they might have missed in class, and gain valuable experience working in groups.</p>

<p>Also, with our chat feature being contained within our app, this can help keep schoolwork and a students personal life seperate by not requiring exchanging phone numbers for communication. Without having a strong network of peers to work with outside of class, students could find themselves at a disadvantage in comparison to others who band together.</p>

<p>Not only would students be able to pursue academic success with our app, but potentially foster friendships that could last a lifetime.</p>
