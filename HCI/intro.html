StoryBoards (Liam and Narmer)

“Catherine stays on campus and is taking an online course on The Art of Digital Video online, she is having trouble with the course material and due to the professor having so many students and the disconnect of them taking the class virtually she has fallen far behind in the material. She looks to our application in hopes of finding a student to study with but all of the students either live off campus or wish to study on their own means because the class does not force them to interact in the physical space. Catherine remains distant from her classmates and instead opts to look the material over again in hopes of better understanding, she improves her grasp on the class but only by a slight margin.”

"Jason is having trouble with Object Oriented Programming, because he is always in a rush and hasn't had the chance to really make friends in the course. So he uses our application in hopes of finding people in the same course looking to study the material, he searches for fellow students by entering his course information and finds a study group close by to where he usually studies on campus. He goes to the study group in the building he is in and they help Jason out with a concept he does not understand and Jason is able to help others out with concepts he understands; Jason finally understands the concept of for and infinite loops!
